Classification
---------------

1. Importing the Packages
2. Exploring the Datasets
	- CASIA Datasets 
3. Image Data Augmentation
	- Re-scaling the Image
	- Shear Transformation
	- Zooming the Image
	- Horizontal Flip 
	- Reshaping the Image 
4. Function for calculating the Recall, Precision and F1 Score
5. Defining the EarlyStopping to avoid either Under/Over Fitting
6. Calling the Model

	- CNN
	- VGG16
	- VGG19
	- Densenet
	- MobileNetV2
	- ResNet50
	- InceptionV3
	- ResNet101
	- ResNet152
	- Xception
	- NasNetMobile
	- Xception + NasNetMobile - Ensemble Model

7. Building and Training the model  
8. Dumping the best model for classifying the abnormalities further

FrontEnd
--------

20. Frontend is developed with help of Flask Framework, along with Registration and Login setup with support of Sqlite DB
21. For the frontend we used the data for classifying
22. User uploads an image
	- Classification
23. The given input is preprocessed for classifying
24. Trained model is used for classifying
25. Final classification and will show tampered part for fake images outcome is displayed through frontend


Extension
----------

In the base paper, the author mentioned to use Xception + NasNet  and compared with different Transfer Learning model for Image forgery classification,
As an extension we have applied NasNetMobile and Ensemble of  Xception with NasNetMobile for analysis the dataset,
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
